[FCL](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) was forked in 2015.
Since then, a large part of the code has been rewritten or removed (for the unused and untested part).
The broad phase was reintroduced by [Justin Carpentier](https://github.com/jcarpent) in 2022 based on the FCL version 0.7.0.

If you use **HPP-FCL** in your projects and research papers, we would appreciate it if you'd [cite it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-fcl/devel/CITATION.bib).

## New features

Compared to the original [FCL](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) library, the main new features are:
- a dedicated and efficient implementation of the GJK algorithm (we do not rely anymore on [libccd](https://github.com/danfis/libccd))
- the support of safety margins for collision detection
- an accelerated version of collision detection *à la Nesterov*, which leads to increased performances (up to a factor of 2). More details are available in this [paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03662157/)
- the computation of a lower bound of the distance between two objects when collision checking is performed, and no collision is found
- the implementation of Python bindings for easy code prototyping
- the support of new geometries such as height fields, capsules, ellipsoids, etc.
- enhance reliability with the fix of a myriad of bugs
- efficient computation of **contact points** and **contact patches** between objects
- full support of object serialization via Boost.Serialization

This project is now used in many robotics frameworks such as [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), an open-source software that implements efficient and versatile rigid body dynamics algorithms, the [Humanoid Path Planner](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc), an open-source software for Motion and Manipulation Planning. **HPP-FCL** has also been recently used to develop [Simple](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/Simple), a new (differentiable) and efficient simulator for robotics and beyond.

## A high-performance library

Unlike the original FCL library, HPP-FCL implements the well-established [GJK algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Keerthi_distance_algorithm) and [its variants](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03662157/) for collision detection and distance computation. These implementations lead to state-of-the-art performances, as depicted by the figures below.

On the one hand, we have benchmarked HPP-FCL against major software alternatives of the state of the art:
1. the [Bullet simulator](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3),
2. the original [FCL library](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) (used in the [Drake framework]()),
3. the [libccd library](https://github.com/danfis/libccd) (used in [MuJoCo](http://mujoco.org/)).

The results are depicted in the following figure, which notably shows that the accelerated variants of GJK largely outperform by a large margin (from 5x up to 15x times faster).
Please notice that the y-axis is in log scale.

</p>

On the other hand, why do we care about dedicated collision detection solvers like GJK for the narrow phase? Why can't we simply formulate the collision detection problem as a quadratic problem and call an off-the-shelf optimization solver like [ProxQP](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite))? Here is why.

</p>

One can observe that GJK-based approaches largely outperform solutions based on classic optimization solvers (e.g., QP solver like [ProxQP](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite)), notably for large geometries composed of tens or hundreds of vertices.

## C++ example
Both the C++ library and the python bindings can be installed as simply as `conda -c conda-forge install hpp-fcl`.
The `.so` library, include files and python bindings will then be installed under `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib`, `$CONDA_PREFIX/include` and `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.XX/site-packages`.

Here is an example of using HPP-FCL in C++:
```cpp
#include "hpp/fcl/math/transform.h"
#include "hpp/fcl/mesh_loader/loader.h"
#include "hpp/fcl/BVH/BVH_model.h"
#include "hpp/fcl/collision.h"
#include "hpp/fcl/collision_data.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Function to load a convex mesh from a `.obj`, `.stl` or `.dae` file.
//
// This function imports the object inside the file as a BVHModel, i.e. a point cloud
// which is hierarchically transformed into a tree of bounding volumes.
// The leaves of this tree are the individual points of the point cloud
// stored in the `.obj` file.
// This BVH can then be used for collision detection.
//
// For better computational efficiency, we sometimes prefer to work with
// the convex hull of the point cloud. This insures that the underlying object
// is convex and thus very fast collision detection algorithms such as
// GJK or EPA can be called with this object.
// Consequently, after creating the BVH structure from the point cloud, this function
// also computes its convex hull.
std::shared_ptr<coal::ConvexBase> loadConvexMesh(const std::string& file_name) {
  coal::NODE_TYPE bv_type = coal::BV_AABB;
  coal::MeshLoader loader(bv_type);
  coal::BVHModelPtr_t bvh = loader.load(file_name);
  bvh->buildConvexHull(true, "Qt");
  return bvh->convex;
}

int main() {
  // Create the coal shapes.
  // Coal supports many primitive shapes: boxes, spheres, capsules, cylinders, ellipsoids, cones, planes,
  // halfspace and convex meshes (i.e. convex hulls of clouds of points).
  // It also supports BVHs (bounding volumes hierarchies), height-fields and octrees.
  std::shared_ptr<coal::Ellipsoid> shape1 = std::make_shared<coal::Ellipsoid>(0.7, 1.0, 0.8);
  std::shared_ptr<coal::ConvexBase> shape2 = loadConvexMesh("../path/to/mesh/file.obj");

  // Define the shapes' placement in 3D space
  coal::Transform3s T1;
  T1.setQuatRotation(coal::Quaternion3f::UnitRandom());
  T1.setTranslation(coal::Vec3s::Random());
  coal::Transform3s T2 = coal::Transform3s::Identity();
  T2.setQuatRotation(coal::Quaternion3f::UnitRandom());
  T2.setTranslation(coal::Vec3s::Random());

  // Define collision requests and results.
  //
  // The collision request allows to set parameters for the collision pair.
  // For example, we can set a positive or negative security margin.
  // If the distance between the shapes is less than the security margin, the shapes
  // will be considered in collision.
  // Setting a positive security margin can be usefull in motion planning,
  // i.e to prevent shapes from getting too close to one another.
  // In physics simulation, allowing a negative security margin may be usefull to stabilize the simulation.
  coal::CollisionRequest col_req;
  col_req.security_margin = 1e-1;
  // A collision result stores the result of the collision test (signed distance between the shapes,
  // witness points location, normal etc.)
  coal::CollisionResult col_res;

  // Collision call
  coal::collide(shape1.get(), T1, shape2.get(), T2, col_req, col_res);

  // We can access the collision result once it has been populated
  std::cout << "Collision? " << col_res.isCollision() << "\n";
  if (col_res.isCollision()) {
    coal::Contact contact = col_res.getContact(0);
    // The penetration depth does **not** take into account the security margin.
    // Consequently, the penetration depth is the true signed distance which separates the shapes.
    // To have the distance which takes into account the security margin, we can simply add the two together.
    std::cout << "Penetration depth: " << contact.penetration_depth << "\n";
    std::cout << "Distance between the shapes including the security margin: " << contact.penetration_depth + col_req.security_margin << "\n";
    std::cout << "Witness point on shape1: " << contact.nearest_points[0].transpose() << "\n";
    std::cout << "Witness point on shape2: " << contact.nearest_points[1].transpose() << "\n";
    std::cout << "Normal: " << contact.normal.transpose() << "\n";
  }

  // Before calling another collision test, it is important to clear the previous results stored in the collision result.
  col_res.clear();

  return 0;
}
```

## Python example
Here is the C++ example from above translated in python using HPP-FCL's python bindings:
```python
import numpy as np
import coal
# Optional:
# The Pinocchio library is a rigid body algorithms library and has a handy SE3 module.
# It can be installed as simply as `conda -c conda-forge install pinocchio`.
# Installing pinocchio also installs hpp-fcl.
import pinocchio as pin

def loadConvexMesh(file_name: str):
    loader = coal.MeshLoader()
    bvh: coal.BVHModelBase = loader.load(file_name)
    bvh.buildConvexHull(True, "Qt")
    return bvh.convex

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create coal shapes
    shape1 = coal.Ellipsoid(0.7, 1.0, 0.8)
    shape2 = loadConvexMesh("../path/to/mesh/file.obj")

    # Define the shapes' placement in 3D space
    T1 = coal.Transform3s()
    T1.setTranslation(pin.SE3.Random().translation)
    T1.setRotation(pin.SE3.Random().rotation)
    T2 = coal.Transform3s();
    # Using np arrays also works
    T1.setTranslation(np.random.rand(3))
    T2.setRotation(pin.SE3.Random().rotation)

    # Define collision requests and results
    col_req = coal.CollisionRequest()
    col_res = coal.CollisionResult()

    # Collision call
    coal.collide(shape1, T1, shape2, T2, col_req, col_res)

    # Accessing the collision result once it has been populated
    print("Is collision? ", {col_res.isCollision()})
    if col_res.isCollision():
        contact: coal.Contact = col_res.getContact(0)
        print("Penetration depth: ", contact.penetration_depth)
        print("Distance between the shapes including the security margin: ", contact.penetration_depth + col_req.security_margin)
        print("Witness point shape1: ", contact.getNearestPoint1())
        print("Witness point shape2: ", contact.getNearestPoint2())
        print("Normal: ", contact.normal)

    # Before running another collision call, it is important to clear the old one
    col_res.clear()
```
